# 🚀 Totem Interactive Assignment: AI Prompt Context Analyzer

## 🌟 Overview
This project is a minimal working prototype designed to enhance conversational AI by providing context-aware follow-up prompts. It analyzes the relationship between a user's original query and the AI's response, identifies critical gaps, and suggests targeted clarifications or elaborations.

The core technology uses a two-stage, prompt-engineered pipeline leveraging the Google AI SDK and the Gemini model to ensure high-quality, actionable analysis.
